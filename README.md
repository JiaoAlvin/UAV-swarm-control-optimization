# How to Run Optimization
All of the source code for the simulation is organized into several directories, however all that you need to run the optimization itself is to run: optimizer.m
Some lines from this file have been commented out, as these were related to saving generated figures to the proper directory for compiling into our final report. But all main functionality is present.

For details of the project refer "Optimization_finalProject_report.pdf"
